  <p class="AboutMe"> As a current student at Thaddeus Stevens, I was given the opportunity to come here and learn about the Computer Software program. So far I have enjoyed my time here and am looking forward to my second semester. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico then I eventually moved to the United States when I was twelve years old. I was a three sport athlete in high school (Football, Basketball, Track &amp; Field). I currently play basketball at Thaddeus Stevens and plan on doing track after the season ends.
