  <p class="p-one"> One of the reasons I chose to join this program was the kind and welcoming atmosphere cultivated by the faculty at my audition. Beyond their abundant wealth of knowledge, the faculty and staff are incredibly caring and invested in our success and well-being. They stimulate us to think on a deeper level; rather than simply teaching us how to execute movement, they encourage us to engage in critical discourse about dance as part of a heuristic path to artistic self-discovery. Their passion for dance keeps me excited for and engaged in the day-to-day work in technique classes.
